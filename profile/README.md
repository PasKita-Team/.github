## PasKita-Mobile-App

"Paskita" project came from an understanding of the important role
that Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) play in the economy, which often have difficulties in
promoting their products and services. We noticed that resources and professional design
skills are limited for SME, making it difficult for them to create effective promotions. Therefore,
the "Paskita" project comes as a solution by giving SME access to a collection of creative
templates that are simple and easy to use. By using the "PasKita" app, SME can easily
customize these templates to create attractive promotions without having to rely on expensive
professional design services.

"Paskita" is really cool! It can really help SMEs to promote themselves easily. There are many benefits, for example, 
you can save costs, create good promotional content without having to bother paying expensive designers. The platform is 
also user-friendly, so everyone can use it without any problems. And not only do they provide templates, but there are also 
tutorials to improve the design and marketing skills of SMEs. You can also share your experiences with other SMEs, so it feels 
more like a community. So, "Paskita" is not only making SMEs more powerful, but also supporting economic growth at large. Great, right?
